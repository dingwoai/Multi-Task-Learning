## Datasets

Commonly used in computer vision:

-  [Taskonomy](http://taskonomy.vision/) is currently the largest dataset specifically designed for multi-task learning. It has about 4.5 million images of indoor scenes from 3D scans of about 600 buildings and every image has an annotation for all 26 tasks.
-  [NYU v2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) is a large-scale dataset for indoor scenes understanding, which contains a variety of computer vision tasks. There are in total 1449 densely labeled RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with 35,064 distinct objects from 894 different classes.
- MultiMNIST is an MTL version of the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. It is formed by overlaying multiple handwrit- ten digit images together. One of these is placed at the top-left while the other at the bottom-right. The tasks are classifying simultaneously the digit on the top-left and on the bottom-right.
- [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains 10,000 identities, each has 20 images, which result a total number of 200,000 images. Since CelebA is annotated with 40 face attributes and 5 key points, it can be used in MTL setting by considering each attribute as a distinct classification task.
- [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) dataset is established for semantic urban scene understanding. It is comprised of 5000 images with high quality pixel-level annotations as well as 20,000 additional images with coarse annotations. Tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and depth estimation are able to be trained together on Cityscapes.
- [MS-COCO](http://mscoco.org/) is a widely used dataset in CV. It contains 382k images with a total of 2.5 million labeled instances spanning 91 objects types. It can be used for multiple tasks including image classification, detection and segmentation.
- [KITTI](www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti) is by far the most famous and commonly used dataset for autonomous driving. It provides benchmarks for multiple driving tasks: e.g. stereo matching, optical flow estimation, visual odometry/SLAM, semantic segmentation, object detection/orientation estimation and object tracking.
- [BDD100K](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/) is a recent driving dataset designed for heterogeneous multitask learning. It is comprised of 100K video clips and 10 tasks: image tagging, lane detection, drivable area segmentation, road object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, multi-object detection tracking, multi-object segmentation tracking, domain adaptation and imitation learning.

- [SIGKDD 2019] Learning a Unified Embedding for Visual Search at Pinterest, [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01707v1)
  - For every mini-batch, we **balance a uniform mix of each of the datasets** with an epoch defined by the iterations to iterate through the largest dataset. Each dataset has its own indepedent tasks so we **ignore the gradient contributions of images on tasks that it does not have data for**. The losses from all the tasks are assigned equal weights and are summed for backward propagation.
